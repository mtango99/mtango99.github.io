## Welcome! 

My name is Madeleine Tango and I am recent graduate from Middlebury College student, having graduated in February 2022. 
I completed a degree in Conservation Biology (joint major between Environmental Studies and Biology) with a minor in Geography. 

I am interested in bringing interdisciplinary solutions to environmental and social issues using foundations in conservation biology, geography, and political ecology. 
I hope to put my skills in GIS and remote sensing to use to fight for a more equitable and biodiverse world in a context where I am always able to learn and develop new skills.

My research interests include: environmental justice spatial analysis, land cover and land use change with remote sensing, natural hazard and contamination management, climate vulnerability and resilience, climate change modelling, coral ecosystems, renewable energy expansion and wildlife impacts, co-design approaches to conservation. 


On this page, you'll find links to various classwork and projects, including my open source porfolio, senior thesis, and remote sensing portfolio.
