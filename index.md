Welcome to my website! My name is Madeleine Tango and I am a Middlebury College student, graduating in February 2022. 
I am completing a degree in Conservation Biology (joint major between Environmental Studies and Biology) with a minor in Geography. 

After graduation, I hope to implement an interdisciplinary approach to fighting climate change and maintaining biodiversity by considering spatial impacts and asking questions 
about equity. I also have deep interest in renewable energy, particularly wind energy, which I explore in my Senior Thesis. 

On this page, you'll find links to various classwork and projects of mine. My GitHub repository itself can be found [here](https://github.com/mtango99).
