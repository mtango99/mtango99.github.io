title: Environmental Vulnerability due to Waste Site Placement Near Water Transmission Features in Dar es Salaam

***QUESTION***

How does environmental risk and vulnerability due to placement of waste sites near water features vary across the wards of Dar es Salaam? 

<br>

***ABSTRACT***
Placement of solid waste sites near water transmission features such as rivers, streams, canals, drains, and ditches can lead to flooding during rain events if these waste collections block water transmission and egress. Not only can this result in flooding, but it can also lead to increased contact between humans and pathogens, toxins, and other environmental hazards. In this analysis we identify waste collection sites within 50 meters of water transmission features as potentially dangerous waste sites and calculate the density of dangerous waste sites for each ward in Dar es Salaam to identify spatial distribution of environmental vulnerability.

***RESULTS***

DSM_results

Clustered in center, where lots of waterways

But data could be based on how they took it

There are many wards with no waste sites. While a few are because the waste sites were not within 50 meters of waterway transmission features, 
in the original waste site layer the waste sites are mostly in the wards that ended up having a greater-than-0 waste site density. 
Thus, it is important to acknowledge that the data collection of the waste sites themselves was limited to particular areas, and the 
lack of waste sites in particular wards may not be representative of reality.






When applying the gravity model specifically to hospital data using [data from Homeland Security](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6ac5e325468c4cb9b905f1728d6fbf0f_0), 
the data need to be preprocessed to: 

1. remove hospitals not meant for public use, hospitals without beds, and closed hospitals, and  
1. aggregate hospitals by ZIP code and calculating the mean coordinates (centroids would also work) of the hospitals, given hospitals close together 
are often in co-operation or would otherwise have the same likelihood a patient would go there.
