I do not think I have any experience with uncertainty in spatial research; since uncertainty can increase at so many different steps of the data collection and analysis projects, and there are often so many numbers already to keep track of in GIS analyses, it sounds pretty difficult have a running calculation of uncertainty as well. While this would be ideal, I think there may also be ways of estimating uncertainty after an analysis is completed. It is important that geographers report potential sources of uncertainty and estimate uncertainties the best they can while maintaining clear, good quality research. I think this is also where we see importance of clear and detailed documentation, so that even if geographers themselves are not calculating uncertainty, other geographers can still get a sense of what the uncertainty may be through looking at the methods and assumptions that went into the work. Creating a norm and ethic of open source work in geography would help with the transparency necessary to calculate, or at the very least better understand, uncertainty.
